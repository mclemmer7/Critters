# Critters
A set of animals are put into a simulation where they wander around and can infect each other. The simulation runs until there is only one animal left standing.
My professor Michael Wood provided these files for me: CritterFrame.java, CritterInfo.java, CritterModel.java, CritterPanel.java, Critter.java, Food.java, Flytrap.java, and CritterMain.java.
I created all of the other files and I followed the instructions for each one, and then I completely created the Gator.java file by myself without and instructions. I designed it to work better than any of the other animals so that it will infect everything else and be the last animal standing in the simulation.
